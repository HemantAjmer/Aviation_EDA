## Project Overview üìä

This project explores a comprehensive aviation dataset containing records of incidents and accidents across multiple decades. The goal is to gain insights into aviation safety by examining patterns, identifying high-risk areas, and understanding contributing factors to incidents.

The project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and summarization of key findings. The insights derived can help guide potential safety improvements and further research in aviation safety.

## Dataset üìÇ

The dataset records aviation incidents and accidents, including attributes such as:
- Date, Location, and Country
- Latitude and Longitude
- Severity and Cause
- Weather Conditions and Phase of Flight

> **Note:** Ensure that you have permission to use and share the dataset, or use a publicly available version of similar aviation data.

## Project Structure üóÇÔ∏è

- `WT_EDA_AVIATION.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full EDA process.
- `Aviation_Dataset_Analysis_Report.docx`: Generated report summarizing the analysis and key insights.
- `AviationData.csv`: Dataset file with aviation incident records.

## Installation üíª

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aviation-eda.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd aviation-eda
3. Install the necessary Python Packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn ydata-profiling
# Usage üõ†Ô∏è
1. Open the Jupyter notebook to explore the data and analysis::
   ```bash
    jupyter notebook WT_EDA_AVIATION.ipynb
2. Follow all that data cleaning and EDA part

# key-findings  üìà
- Incident Trends Over Time: Incident frequencies varied over time, indicating possible changes in reporting or safety practices.
- Geographic Patterns: Certain regions showed higher incident frequencies, suggesting that these areas may require additional safety focus.
- Weather and Flight Phase Correlation: Incidents during particular weather conditions or flight phases highlighted high-risk scenarios.

# Conclusion and Next Steps
The EDA reveals significant patterns in aviation incidents, guiding potential future work:
  - Further Analysis: Additional analysis on high-risk areas or weather-related incidents could be valuable.
  - Predictive Modeling: Develop predictive models for incident risk based on location, weather, and flight phase.
